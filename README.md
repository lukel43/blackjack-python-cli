# blackjack-python-cli

A command line blackjack game written in Python! I was messing around with object orientation in Python and wanted to create a fun little game out of and this was the result. I am still working on cleaning up the code and output, but it is fully functional. This blackjack game pits you against an AI dealer, and enables you to bet virtual chips.

## Dependencies

The only thing required to run this program is Python 3 and the random module that comes with it!

## How to play

In order to play, just clone this repository! Then, run ```python3 blackjack.py``` from the ```/src``` directory in order to begin a game. From there, answer command line prompts to play.
